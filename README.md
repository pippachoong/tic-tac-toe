Wish list:



    Render a game board in the browser

    Switch turns between X and O (or whichever markers you select); your game should prevent users from playing a turn into a square that is already occupied

    Visually display which side won if a player gets three in a row; or show a draw/"catâ€™s game" if neither wins

    Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files






    Stick with KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles

    Use Javascript with jQuery (or vanilla DOM methods if you really prefer) for DOM manipulation

    Deploy your game online, where the rest of the world can access it

    Use semantic markup for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)
