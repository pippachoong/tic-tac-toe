This game is inspired by Candy Crush where it involves crushing as many sugar confectionary to earn points by matching 3 similar candies. 

This tic tac toe game involves 2 players. Basically, in order to win the game, place 3 similar of your marks in a row: horizontal, vertical, or diagonal. 

There is also an option to challenge a robot where it is located on top of the scoreboard.

Tech used in this games are HTML, JS, CSS and jQuery. 



Issues:
1. The toggle button on web is not able to turn off and on like a normal switch button. More time needed to explore how the CSS and JS can work. 


Wish lists:
1. This game would be able to adapt to other electronic media devices like phone, tables by using  media queries in CSS. 
2. As the game is inspired by Candy Crush, hope to learn more about CSS animations such as bursting effect of the candies once 3 similar candies are matched.
